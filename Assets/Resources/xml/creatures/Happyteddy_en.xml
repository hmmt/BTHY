          Employee M2434: “I was on rounds for the night shift. Happy Teddy didn’t need much attention, it was usually harmless. I looked inside the containment facility, just to check. Teddy was embracing someone. For a while, I thought it was [Redacted]. [Redacted] was in charge of the Teddy so I thought he was staying late to take care of him. Teddy likes hugs, but something was off. I decided to ask [Redacted] whether he wanted to take off or not. I went into the area and called for [Redacted] but there was no answer. I pulled the emergency switch and called for help. Apparently, [Redacted] had been dead for 8 hours. [Redacted] had been in Teddy’s arm since morning, until night-time when I found him.
