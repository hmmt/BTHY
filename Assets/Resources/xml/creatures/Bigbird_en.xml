      {There is a tale of a monster that lays in deep, dark, empty forests to lure in humans.
      To protect all creatures from this large beast, Big Bird made a wick with all of its feathers. With that wick it made a lamp that would burn forever.
      With the eternally lit lamp, it wandered the forest warning the people not to go deep into the forest.
      Thanks to the Big Bird, the number of creatures that were attacked decreased. But still the Big Bird felt bad for the people who died in the hands of the beast.
      Big Bird had a thought, “If I kill them first,  they wouldn’t be killed by the monster!”
      After that rumors flew around about a monster that would bite your head off.
      It is said that the creature stares in order to make sure that you are not the monster.
      This tale is from a town in [Location Redacted] area. It is an oldest folk tale from the town and it was told by the town’s oldest inhabitant [Redacted]. Though there is a general assumption that the tale was told to prevent kids from going into the forest, it is uncertain who started the tale.
