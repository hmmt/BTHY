      {Experiment Log x2-321
      We categorized all sins man makes into three levels. Level 1, ‘insignificant lie or action that wouldn’t draw any attention, kind that one would be able to talk about in a social setting and laugh at.’ Level 2, ‘slightly serious mistake that you would only talk to your closest friends about.’ Level 3, ‘a great sin that one would carry around for their entire life and tell no one about.’
      Employee, [Redacted] was sent in to confess to a Level 1 sin.
      The select Illutionite’s stress levels decreased 10% and energy levels increased 12%.
      Employee, [Redacted] was sent in to confess to a Level 2 sin.
      The select Illutionite’s stress levels decreased 13% and energy levels increased 15%.
      Employee, [Redacted] was sent in to confess to a Level 3 sin.
      1min. 48 sec. after the employee went in, a bright light flashed. Inferring from amount of light that had leaked outside the containment zone, inside may have been blindingly bright. Our offices experienced a power outage right afterwards. The blackout continued for 2 hours. The select Illutionite’s stress levels increased 5% and energy levels decreased. [Redacted] lost past 6 years’ memories. The experiment came to a halt. Privacy matters warranted a policy to keep surveillance cameras classified. But to understand the incident there was no choice but to view the surveillance material.
      The following is an excerpt from the video. All of the footage was not available; the data was damaged from the moment of the blinding flash of light.

I had a neighborhood friend I used to hang out with. We were close, I think. One day, there was something like a Halloween party. We decided to dress up as animals. One of my friends was a deer. The costume was made with some crappy antlers, and some clothes with dark spots on it, not convincing at all. I… I don’t know how the kid got into the forest. We noticed he was gone after a while, maybe an hour. We found him wandering around between the trees, and yelled ‘STOP!’ I guess he thought we were calling him here. He ran toward us and… We heard a few gunshots and that was it. The blood splattered to my shoes. We never dressed up like animals again. That’s it."}

A boy named [Redacted] was indeed shot to death 3 times with a shotgun after entering the forest dressed like a deer, during hunting season.

Also, the witness mentioned hearing children yell ‘RUN,’ immediately before the blast of the shotgun.}
