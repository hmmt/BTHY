          {Excerpt from Experiment Log
          After setting the radio to 1.76MHz, the researcher monitored the situation. 
          12 minutes had passed when someone’s voice along with static noise was heard. It was an indistinguishable foreign language.
          Inferred from the tone, the voice most probably was in a desperate situation and was calling for help.
          17 minutes had passed when the voice was cut off and 3 loud explosive sounds and 2 smaller explosions were heard. Numerous cries and gunshot noises were mixed together. 
          23 minutes had passed when the noises passed and silence fell. 

          After this experiment, the creature was determined as an Abnormarlity, and was put on the schedule for regular monitoring through a dispatched employee. When 3 or more employees are sent in, in most cases, some of the employees experience anger and showed aggressive behavior toward anyone in close proximity. A witness described the spectacle as one that you might see in an insane and venerable place like a war-zone. All employees who have experienced these symptoms refused to be interviewed (mandatory interviews were impossible because there were no casualties) and there was no way to find out what made them display such feelings of ‘group anger’
